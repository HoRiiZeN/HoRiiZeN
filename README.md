# Hi, I'm Nabil 👋

💻 **IT hobbyist** slowly turning curiosity into skills.

## 🔍 What I'm curious about
**Linux, DevOps, and Cloud**

## 📂 What you'll find here

If you want to see the messy learning process, check my repos:
- Labs and experiments
- Learning notes
- Small scripts
> Everything I learn is logged in my DevOps journal (I've only started logging recently).

## ⚡ When I'm not learning
I read manga, watch anime, or play games.
